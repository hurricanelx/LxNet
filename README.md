# LxNet
A very simple CNN with Numpy

## Layers

contain Maxpool,ReLU,FC,Conv,AvgPool and Softmax
All these layers are implemented by Numpy with loops


## Solver

The Solver class help to train the model and to adjust each layer with the gradient 


## test

A very simple example is written in test.py
You may find that the model can not fit the data very well.
It may due to the very shallow structure.
